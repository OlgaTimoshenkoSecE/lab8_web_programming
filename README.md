 1) Found API for wizards from Harry Potter book series and decided to make an interactive page which will show the character's birthday, full name, hogwarts house, image and the actor who played it. 
 2) Tried to fetch the data, then specified what king of data (for which character) i need based on the user's input.
 3) Started doing the layout for the page in HTML & CSS.
